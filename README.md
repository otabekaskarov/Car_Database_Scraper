# Car_Database_Scraper
Make your own database about car prices, age, fuel consumption and mileage


You can find the code in Scrape_car_websites.py
I used autoscout24.com to scrape the data about Skoda Octavia. 
We needed to create our own database from real life so I decided to use webscraping for that
We needed a database for our Statistics Seminar Paper, where we used this data for Multiple Regression Model.
Basically this code scrapes the prices, the odometer value of a car, the fuel consumption per 100 kilometers and the year of first registration.
